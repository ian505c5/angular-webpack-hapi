# Migrations

Keep your Migrations in this directory. It's recommended to prefix the files with an incrementing number or timestamp. Otherwise it might be hard to keep track of the order the DB changes were executed.

## Migration
```
$ gulp db:migrate
```

## Rollback
```
$ gulp db:rollback
```

## Seed
```
$ gulp db:seed
```
